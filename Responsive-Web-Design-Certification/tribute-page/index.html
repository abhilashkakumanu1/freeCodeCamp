            <p class="content"><span class="bold">When</span> I first entered NITK, Surathkal, I felt out of place. I was a shy kid and the grandeur, openness of it were overwhelming. And the fact that I was joining one month late made it even worse. It took me quite some time to adjust and create my own small bubble of comfort. For most of the first two years, I revolved in between classes, hostel room, and mess. I haven’t explored even a tiny bit of opportunities my college has in its store. But it all changed in my third year when I took up a project-based course.</p>
            <p class="content"><span class="bold">In</span> that course, we are supposed to work in teams. This single experience forced me out of my comfort zone and introduced me to a ton of people. I started seeing the other side of my college, the cooler, nerdier side of it. One thing I respect about my college is the freedom of exploration it gives. Me doing my graduation in mechanical engineering and yet being able to spend most of my time doing Electronic and Computer Science projects is a testimony to it.</p>
            <p class="content"><span class="bold">As</span> I started to move out of shyness (or rather forced out of it), I started to interact with more and more people. Oh my goodness, there are hell lot of weirdos, interested in different things, coming from different cultures and yet co-existing like cousins (Okay..better than cousins!). The abundance of young people (and the perspectives they bring along) is what makes a college so special. I am ever grateful for the well-knit fraternity that NITK has created. At last, when I look back all I see is my friends and the time spent with them. That’s what NITK is for me. </p>
