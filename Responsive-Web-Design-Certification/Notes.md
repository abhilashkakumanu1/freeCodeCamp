# Responsive Web design

### Basic HTML and HTML5
- h1, h2, h3, .. => Different __levels__ of headings
- HTML5 introduces more descriptive tags - main, header, footrt, nav, article, section, video, etc. These also help with __SEO__
- img tag is __self closing__
- We can use anchor tag to create __internal links__ as well. We use __href="#id"__ in that case
- __href ="#"__ creates a dead link
- _required_ is a __boolean attribute__
-  Forms:
	- _for_ of the label should match with the _id_ of the input. Also, using same 	_name_ attribute creates a __radio group__
	- Radio buttons are generally used for single answer and checkboxes for multi correct questions
	- _name, value_ get submitted at the end. The default value is _on_. We generally use the lowercase version of label as value
	- _checked_ boolean attribute can be used to have inputs checked by default
- div => division element
